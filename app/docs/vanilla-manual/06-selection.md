# 06 · Row Selection

Selection lets users pick one or many rows — for bulk actions, exporting just the selected rows, etc. Selection is **off by default**; you turn it on with the `selection` group.

> **What "selection" means here:** the grid keeps a private list of *which row IDs are currently ticked*. It does not change your data — selecting a row just adds its ID to that list and highlights the row. You then read the list (via an event or the API) to do something with those rows: delete them, export them, show a "3 selected" toolbar, and so on.

---

## The three selection modes

The `mode` option decides how many rows can be ticked at once:

| Mode | Behaviour | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'none'` | Selection is off (the default). | Read-only tables. |
| `'single'` | At most **one** row selected; picking another clears the first — like radio buttons. | "Choose one record to view." |
| `'multiple'` | Any number of rows; checkboxes and a "select all" header. | Bulk delete/export. |

---

## Turning selection on

```ts
const grid = createGrid<User>({
  columns,
  data,
  selection: {
    mode: 'multiple',   // 'none' | 'single' | 'multiple'
  },
})
```

Setting `mode` to anything other than `'none'` automatically shows a checkbox column.

## Selection options

| Property | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `'none' \| 'single' \| 'multiple'` | `'none'` | How many rows can be selected |
| `selectAllScope` | `'page' \| 'all'` | `'page'` | Does the header checkbox select the page or everything? |
| `showCheckboxes` | `boolean` | `true` (when mode ≠ none) | Show the checkbox column |
| `selectOnRowClick` | `boolean` | `true` | Clicking anywhere in a row selects it |
| `checkboxOnly` | `boolean` | `false` | Only the checkbox selects (clicking the row does nothing) |

### Single selection (radio-style)

```ts
selection: { mode: 'single' }
```

### Multiple selection with a "select all" that covers everything

The checkbox in the **header** is "select all". `selectAllScope` decides what "all" means when pagination or virtualization is in play:

- `'page'` (default) — ticks only the rows currently visible on this page. Safer: the user can clearly see everything they just selected.
- `'all'` — ticks every row that passes the current filter, even ones on other pages or scrolled out of view.

```ts
selection: {
  mode: 'multiple',
  selectAllScope: 'all',   // header checkbox selects ALL rows, not just this page
}
```

### Checkbox-only selection

Useful when clicking a row should do something else (like open a detail panel) and only the checkbox should toggle selection:

```ts
selection: {
  mode: 'multiple',
  checkboxOnly: true,
  selectOnRowClick: false,
}
```

---

## Reacting to selection changes

`onSelectionChange` receives the **array of selected row objects** (not just IDs), so you can act on the data directly:

```ts
events: {
  onSelectionChange: (selectedRows) => {
    console.log(`${selectedRows.length} rows selected`)
    console.log('Names:', selectedRows.map((r) => r.name))
  },
}
```

---

## Controlling selection from code (the API)

```ts
api.selectRow('42')        // select by row ID
api.deselectRow('42')
api.toggleRow('42')        // flip its state
api.selectAll()
api.deselectAll()

api.isRowSelected('42')    // → boolean
api.getSelectedRows()      // → TData[] (the row objects)
api.getSelectedIds()       // → Set<string> (just the IDs)
```

> **`getSelectedRows()` vs `getSelectedIds()` — which do I want?**
>
> - Use **`getSelectedRows()`** when you need the *data* — names to display, fields to send to a server.
> - Use **`getSelectedIds()`** when you only need *identity* — e.g. to pass to `api.deleteRows([...])`. It returns a **`Set`**, a JavaScript collection of unique values. A `Set` has no array methods like `.map`, so spread it into an array first when you need those: `[...api.getSelectedIds()]`.

> **Remember:** these use the **row ID**, which comes from your `rowId` setting (default field `id`). See [Chapter 01](/docs/vanilla/getting-started#what-is-rowid-important).

## Example — a bulk delete button

```ts
import { buildGridAPI } from '@elitegrid/core'

const api = buildGridAPI(grid)
const deleteBtn = document.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>('#delete-selected')!

deleteBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const ids = [...api.getSelectedIds()]
  api.deleteRows(ids)     // bulk delete in one pass
  api.deselectAll()
})
```

See [Chapter 12](/docs/vanilla/grid-api) for `buildGridAPI()` vs. waiting for `onReady`.

## Selection survives paging and filtering

Selection is tracked by **row ID**, independently of what's currently on screen — not by "which checkboxes are visible right now." That means:

- Selecting rows on page 1, then moving to page 2, keeps page 1's rows selected.
- Applying a filter that hides a selected row does **not** deselect it — it's just not visible while the filter is active. Clear the filter and it will still show as checked.

This is almost always what users expect ("I picked these 5 rows, don't lose them because I scrolled"), but it means a selection count in your UI should come from `api.getSelectedIds().size` (or a live subscription — see below), not from counting checked boxes on the current page.

If you specifically want "select all" to mean *only this page* rather than every filtered row, that's what `selectAllScope: 'page'` (the default) already does — see above.

> **Reading selection reactively.** Rather than manually tracking a count via `onSelectionChange`, subscribe directly to the `selection` namespace on `grid.kernel.store` — it calls your function again every time the selection changes, and hands back an `unsubscribe` function:
>
> ```ts
> const badge = document.querySelector<HTMLSpanElement>('#selection-count')!
>
> function render(state: { count: number; selectedIds: Set<string>; isAllSelected: boolean }) {
>   badge.textContent = `${state.count} selected`
> }
>
> render(grid.kernel.store.read('selection'))
> const unsubscribe = grid.kernel.store.subscribe('selection', render)
> ```

## Pre-selecting rows on load

To open the grid with certain rows already selected (e.g. restoring a saved selection, or highlighting rows passed in from another page), select them in `onReady`:

```ts
const grid = createGrid<User>({
  columns,
  data,
  selection: { mode: 'multiple' },
  events: {
    onReady: (api) => {
      const preselectedIds = ['12', '47', '88']
      preselectedIds.forEach((id) => api.selectRow(id))
    },
  },
})
```

## Common selection mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "3 selected" badge shows the wrong count after filtering | Counting checked DOM checkboxes instead of reading the API/store | Use `api.getSelectedIds().size` or subscribe to `grid.kernel.store` on the `'selection'` namespace as the source of truth |
| `selectRow('42')` does nothing | The ID passed doesn't match any row's `rowId` | Double-check your `rowId` setting (see [Chapter 01](/docs/vanilla/getting-started#what-is-rowid-important)) — a mismatched type (`42` vs `'42'`) also silently fails to match |
| Clicking a row toggles selection when it shouldn't | `selectOnRowClick` defaults to `true` | Set `selectOnRowClick: false` (optionally with `checkboxOnly: true`) if rows should only select via their checkbox |
| "Select all" selected far more rows than expected | `selectAllScope: 'all'` selects every *filtered* row, not just the visible page | Use the default `'page'` scope, or make the scope explicit in your UI copy ("Select all 240 results") so it isn't a surprise |
